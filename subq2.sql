Land Registry Price Paid dataset
 
Question: which postcodes in SW12 have not had a single property sale since the Land Registry records begin?
Table PostcodeSW12, from the ONS, contains every postcode in SW12
The pcds column matches the PricePaidSW12.PostCode column. pcds is a unique key.
This is the post code format with a single space between the two parts.
The PostcodeSW12 contains lots of other attributes for the post code e.g. lat and long

  /*
LEFT JOIN approach
 
The LEFT JOIN returns all rows from the PostcodeSW12 table and will return a NULL value for any column on PricePaidSW12
where there is no match.
The query filters rows where a PricePaidSW12 column IS NULL and so returns the postcode without sales
